## Mirror
Mirror is a **high level** Networking library for **Unity 2019/2020 LTS**, compatible with different **low level** [Transports](https://github.com/vis2k/Mirror#low-level-transports).

Mirror is for indie games & small [MMOs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDCNff1S9ZU), made by the developers of [uMMORPG](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/ummorpg-components-edition-159401) and [Cubica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_f_MntrLVE).

Mirror is optimized for **ease of use** & **probability of success**.

We needed a networking library that allows us to **[launch our games](https://mirror-networking.com/showcase/)** and **survive the next decade**.

Mirror is **[stable](https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/general/tests)** & **[production](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2564158073609422/)** ready.
